# Data Engineering SQL Portfolio

This repository contains structured SQL challenges and projects completed as part of my journey toward becoming a Data Engineer. It focuses on real-world query patterns, data transformation logic, and foundational skills needed to support ETL pipelines and analytics workflows.

---

## Structure

- `fundamentals/`  
  Basic SQL: SELECT statements, WHERE filters, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, simple aggregations.

- `intermediate/`  
  Complex queries: Subqueries, HAVING clauses, CASE WHEN logic, CTEs (Common Table Expressions).

- `advanced/`  
  Multi-table joins, window functions, layered transformations, and full workflow simulations.

- `notes/`  
  Learning logs, reflections, and tracking of concepts mastered.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:
- A clear, methodical growth of SQL skills over time
- Practical problem-solving through query design
- Readiness for data engineering roles requiring strong SQL capabilities

Each challenge file is annotated to explain the logic behind the solution.

---

## Tools and Technologies

- SQL (Primarily MySQL; exposure to PostgreSQL and ANSI SQL standards)
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Visual Studio Code for query development and organization

---

## Growth Philosophy

This portfolio captures my learning process, not just final answers.  
Mistakes, refactorings, and improvements are part of the journey.

Mastery is built through deliberate practice, not shortcuts.
